# Contact Form

## Problem Overview

Build a simple contact form using React that captures user input and displays the submitted details.

The form should collect:

- First name
- Last name
- Email
- Message

Upon submission, the entered data should be displayed below the form.

---

## Functional Requirements

1. Render a form with input fields for:
   - First Name
   - Last Name
   - Email
   - Message

2. All fields must be controlled components.

3. On clicking the submit button:
   - The submitted details should appear below the form
   - The form inputs should reset

---

## Constraints

- Use React functional components
- Use React hooks for state management
- Do not mutate state directly

---

## Expected Behavior

- Input fields reflect state changes immediately
- Submitted data is rendered accurately
- UI updates without page reload
