## Problem Overview

Build a React application to manage patient medical records.

Each record includes:

The application should allow adding new patient records and display them in a table.

## Functional Requirements

1. Render a form with inputs for:
   - Patient Name
   - Age
   - Diagnosis
   - Date of Visit

2. On form submission:
   - A new patient record should be added to the table
   - The form inputs should reset

3. Display all patient records in a table format.

- Use hooks for state management
- Do not mutate state directly

## Expected Behavior

- Records appear in the order they are added
- Inputs are controlled components
- UI updates immediately after submission
